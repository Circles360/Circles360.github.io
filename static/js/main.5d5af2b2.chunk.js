In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.For further information please see ENGG1000Read more","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":["SENGAH"],"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":["DESN2000","ENGG2600"]},"position":{"x":256.7493576499096,"y":-334.09498464007453},"style":{"display":"flex","boxShadow":"0px 0px 3px grey","textAlign":"center","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","fontSize":8,"color":"white","background":"#ca300a","width":64,"height":64,"borderRadius":32,"filter":"brightness(1)"},"isHidden":false},{"id":"MATH1081","type":"custom1","data":{"course_name":"Discrete Mathematics","course_code":"MATH1081","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 1","Term 3","Term 2"],"faculty":"Faculty of Science","school":"School of Mathematics & Statistics","desc":"Role of proof in mathematics, logical reasoning and implication, different types of proofs.

(Honours)","code":"3053","desc":"Biotechnology can be defined as the use of various biological processes to make products and perform services. In biotechnology, living cells and biochemical macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are applied in a rapidly expanding range of activities of direct benefit to society. Biotechnology is used for the production of pharmaceuticals, food and industrial chemicals, in the development of improved crops and livestock for farming, for environmental clean-up, and in forensics. Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.The development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.Microorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests. Diagnostic kits are being developed for use in forensic science and in product identification and quality control. Genetic improvements in agriculture, plants and animals are becoming a reality, as is the control of inborn genetic disorders in humans. The ability to treat diseased and injured organs with replacement cells and tissues generated outside of the body is advancing rapidly.The future for expansion in all the above areas is immense. Our ability to cope with many medical, environmental, agricultural and manufacturing problems in the 21st century will depend heavily on advances in biotechnology.","faculty":"Faculty of Science","units":192,"duration":4,"structure":{"Disciplinary Component":168,"General Education":12,"Course Information Rule":null,"Excluded General Education Courses":null,"Free Electives":12,"Suggested Free Electives":null},"degrees_involved":{"majors":[],"minors":[],"honours":[]}},"3061":{"name":"Food Science (Honours)","code":"3061","desc":"The UNSW Bachelor of Science (Honours) Food Science program is designed to equip you for a career as a professional food scientist.
