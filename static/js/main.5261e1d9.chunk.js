They will learn to think the way that engineers think, coming up with good solutions to problems despite being limited by budget, time and resources, the requirement to also meet environmental and social objectives and of course the limitations of the laws of physics.

They will be assigned to a team to work over a ten week period to solve a practical problem. The projects on offer change from year to year.  In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.For further information please see ENGG1000Read more","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":["SENGAH"],"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":["DESN2000","ENGG2600"]},"position":{"x":256.7493576499096,"y":-334.09498464007453},"style":{"display":"flex","textAlign":"center","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","fontSize":10,"color":"white","background":"#CA1818","width":64,"height":64,"borderRadius":32,"filter":"brightness(1.15)","border":"2px dashed #CA1818"},"isHidden":false},{"id":"MATH1081","type":"custom1","data":{"course_name":"Discrete Mathematics","course_code":"MATH1081","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 1","Term 2","Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Science","school":"School of Mathematics & Statistics","desc":"Role of proof in mathematics, logical reasoning and implication, different types of proofs.

It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as \'converse\' with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen\'s literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers: her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism.

At some point during the eighteenth century, this question went from being more or less meaningless to one of the central preoccupations of Western literature and culture: the driving principle of countless\u2014if not most\u2014classic novels, and the occasion for many canonical works in other genres and media. The idea that the shape of an individual life follows a basic pattern of development, leading from the open-ended possibility of youth to the stable identity of adulthood, seems self-evident to us, but this idea has a history: it has been figured, configured and reconfigured in many different ways over the past 250 years, and continues to mutate and develop under our eyes today. The aim of this course is to track the related ideas of youth, adulthood and development over this period, as they are represented in key works of literature and cinema, and especially within the genre of the Bildungsroman. Our inquiry will be guided by the assumption that narratives of development, in prose, poetry and film, are not only passive reflections of reality, but rather that these literary and film representations are essential tools for making sense of our time-bound lives. Accordingly, your engagement with these questions will take the form of class discussion and a traditional essay, but also an original narrative in which you implement your understanding of the genre. The course is designed as a history of ideas and representations, but also as a toolkit, which will help us think about what it means to come of age in our own society and how best to approach the problem of education.","conditions":{"raw":"Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, English","prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":48,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"ARTS3055":{"course_name":"Literature and Power","course_code":"ARTS3055","course_level":3,"units":6,"terms":["Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences","school":"School of the Arts and Media","desc":"This course\xa0posits literature as a social construction and explores literature\u2019s link to power.\xa0It theorises the relations of literature to the economic, social and political spheres and analyses the evolution of these relations in the digital age.

Over the last century, however, it has become institutionalised and professionalised and, as the disciplinary name Political Science suggests, has sought to put the study of politics on a footing comparable to the aims, methods, and conventions presumed integral to the natural sciences. Yet the possibility, desirability, and even meaning of a \u201cscience of politics\u201d are controversial issues. This course examines fundamental questions about what political knowledge is and how it is acquired the \'art\', craft of political science, that can be learned, practiced and improved over times.\xa0This goal is achieved by reading and engaging in careful study of several seminar works in contemporary political science. In almost every week, we study a well designed and effectively executed research work as an example of how the \'art\' of political science is practiced in various branches of the discipline, including normative, formal and empirical studies.","conditions":{"raw":"Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following specialisations, Politics and International Relations","prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":48,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"ARTS3850":{"course_name":"Security in Asia: Politics Meets Economics","course_code":"ARTS3850","course_level":3,"units":6,"terms":null,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences","school":"School of Social Sciences","desc":"In this course you will examine the complex and dynamic relationship between political and economic processes and outcomes in Asia.

Social researchers do not apply a set of neutral techniques to the issues they investigate, but rather research is part of a dynamic, engagement with social and cultural worlds with often deep connections to colonial thought and power. A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers: that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability.

They will learn to think the way that engineers think, coming up with good solutions to problems despite being limited by budget, time and resources, the requirement to also meet environmental and social objectives and of course the limitations of the laws of physics. This will help them to appreciate the central ideas of engineering design as an on-time, on-budget and fit for purpose solution to a poorly specified, open-ended problem. They will be assigned to a team to work over a ten week period to solve a practical problem. The projects on offer change from year to year.  In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.For further information please see ENGG1000Read more","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":["MANF4100"]},"ENGG1100":{"course_name":"Grand Challenges for Engineering","course_code":"ENGG1100","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 1","Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":null,"desc":"These special projects are designed for highly motivated undergraduates seeking the opportunity to integrate specific curricular and co-curricular components into their undergraduate program, to provide them with superior preparation and experience in a project area.","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"ENGG1200":{"course_name":"Undergraduate Special Projects","course_code":"ENGG1200","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 1","Term 2","Term 3","Summer Term"],"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":null,"desc":"These special projects are designed for highly motivated undergraduates seeking the opportunity to integrate specific curricular and co-curricular components into their undergraduate program, to provide them with superior preparation and experience in a project area.","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"ENGG1300":{"course_name":"Engineering Mechanics","course_code":"ENGG1300","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 2","Term 3","Summer Term"],"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":"School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering","desc":"This is the\xa0 foundational mechanics course for students in Aerospace, Civil, Environmental, Manufacturing, Mechanical, Mechatronics and Mining Engineering, with content as follows: Revision of vectors, resultants and components, moments; The free body diagram; Equilibrium of planar rigid objects; Equilibrium of systems of co-planar multi-force members and planar trusses; Frames and Machines; Springs; Friction; Mass centre, centroids, distributed forces; Internal forces in beams; Introduction to 3-dimensional statics; Plane particle kinematics, including curvilinear and relative motion; Plane particle kinetics, including equations of motion, work-energy-power, friction, impulse-momentum, impact; Kinetics of systems of particles; Introduction to plane kinematics of rigid bodies, types of rigid body motion (translation, rotation about a fixed axis); Mass moment of inertia, parallel axis theorem, moment of inertia for various shapes, Introduction to plane kinetics of rigid bodies, rigid body in plane motion, equations of motion, work-energy for a rigid body.","conditions":{"raw":"Pre-requisite: (MATH1131 OR DPST1013 OR MATH1141) AND (PHYS1121 OR PHYS1131 OR PHYS1141 OR DPST1023)","prereqs_executable":"( MATH1131 || 0 || MATH1141 ) && ( PHYS1121 || PHYS1131 || PHYS1141 || 0 )","prerequisites":["MATH1131","MATH1141","PHYS1121","PHYS1131","PHYS1141"],"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":["CVEN1300","MMAN1300"],"exclusions":null,"unlocks":["AERO3660","CVEN2303","CVEN3301","CVEN3303","CVEN3304","ENGG2400","MMAN2300","MMAN3200"]},"ENGG1400":{"course_name":"Engineering Infrastructure Systems","course_code":"ENGG1400","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 2"],"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering","desc":"A course in optimization and modelling for first year engineering students who desire a higher capability in the application of the modelling of engineering systems, and seek to acquire a set of optimization tools that can be applied to various engineering applications.

Issues like these are why subjects like space mining are in need of people from other disciplines, to help understand all of the other problems in this and similar fields and how those problems might be solved.","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"GENE1015":{"course_name":"Environmental Sustainability - Methods, Tools, Management","course_code":"GENE1015","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":null,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering","desc":"","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"GENE1500":{"course_name":"Creative Entrepreneurship","course_code":"GENE1500","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 1","Summer Term","Term 3","Term 2"],"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":null,"desc":"What is creativity?

We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice?

You will see how to view many linear transformations as being made up of \\"stretches\\" in various directions, (the diagonalisation process), and the more general Jordan form.

This course provides instruction in the theory and practice of strategic planning as an integrative activity and adopts an applied focus in considering a contemporary multifaceted planning issue. The key drivers of change within our cities, for example housing supply and affordability, urban renewal, urban justice, infrastructure and transport, are unpacked, and the tensions that shape how decisions get made - or not - understood through the complex lens of urban governance and how planning - and planners - engaged with those we plan for. As planners we are interested in the inherently spatial dimensions of these urban processes, recognising that collective efforts to influence land use change and behaviours of urban stakeholders take place at different geographical scales, and impact on different groups in different ways.

The performance of our economy impacts on the availability of jobs, mortgage interest rates, the value of the Australian dollar, the prices we pay in the supermarket and our overall standard of living. As such, macroeconomic performance affects everyone. In this course we explore simplified models of the macroeconomy, and use deductive reasoning and available data, to try to understand how the various macroeconomic variables interact and produce the outcomes that so concern society as a whole.

Indeed, there are significant advantages to contracting parties under various regimes (both tax and non-tax) for the parties to avoid their services relationship being one of employment. This course examines the taxation treatment of employee remuneration and closely analogous remuneration situations under various Australian taxation regimes. Central to the operation of many of these regimes is the presence of an employer/employee relationship, which is often contrasted with the principal/independent contractor relationship. Often, the latter relationship is not caught by the main taxation regimes. Remuneration for services also is often provided in non-cash form. This course examines all the key Australian tax regimes that apply to employee remuneration and situations closely analogous to employee remuneration. While the main focus is the various regimes under the federal income tax (e.g. employment termination payments, employee share schemes), the following are also covered: state payroll tax obligations of employers, superannuation guarantee obligations of employers and fringe benefits tax. In addition, there is also a focus on tax collection and remittance obligations of employers under the PAYG regime.

In biotechnology, living cells and biochemical macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are applied in a rapidly expanding range of activities of direct benefit to society. Biotechnology is used for the production of pharmaceuticals, food and industrial chemicals, in the development of improved crops and livestock for farming, for environmental clean-up, and in forensics. Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.The development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.Microorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests. Diagnostic kits are being developed for use in forensic science and in product identification and quality control. Genetic improvements in agriculture, plants and animals are becoming a reality, as is the control of inborn genetic disorders in humans. The ability to treat diseased and injured organs with replacement cells and tissues generated outside of the body is advancing rapidly.The future for expansion in all the above areas is immense.
