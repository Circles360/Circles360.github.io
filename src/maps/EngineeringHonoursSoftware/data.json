They will learn to think the way that engineers think, coming up with good solutions to problems despite being limited by budget, time and resources, the requirement to also meet environmental and social objectives and of course the limitations of the laws of physics. This will help them to appreciate the central ideas of engineering design as an on-time, on-budget and fit for purpose solution to a poorly specified, open-ended problem. They will be assigned to a team to work over a ten week period to solve a practical problem. The projects on offer change from year to year.  In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.For further information please see ENGG1000Read more",

This course arms students with the knowledge and expertise to design and engineer services using modern Web technologies. Based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, students will be exposed to various design and implementation methodologies, including microservices and their associated design patterns, and API design and management. In addition, this course will strengthen students’ data modeling expertise, covering topics on semantic modelling of both simple and complex structures, and its usage in business analysis. The course will also describe the technical standards and technologies that support semantic data modelling. After completing this course, students will be able to (i) describe different architectural design approaches and their role in engineering software. (ii) apply Web service composition techniques in a concrete setting, (iii) be competent in designing, managing, documenting, testing and securing APIs, (iv) understand techniques for semantic modelling of simple and complex structures, as well as their associated technical standards and technologies.",

A business process is a set of related activities that jointly realise a business goal in an organisational and technical environment. These processes take place in a single organisation but may need to interact with processes in other organisations. Business process management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, and techniques that support the design, improvement, management, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes that deliver lean and customer focused business processes. BPM includes process modelling that explicitly represents processes – once they are defined, processes can be analysed, improved, and enacted. Software in the form of business process management systems can be used to manage business process.",

Specifically, INFS3605 is the ‘capstone’ IS course that is centrally organised around practical, experiential, group software projects. Throughout the course, students will apply programming knowledge and teamwork skills learnt in previous courses in an applied and integrated fashion. The course begins with student groups brainstorming and developing their software project ideas and then gathering requirements. Following this, student groups engage in an iterative development process in designing and refining their software application. Specifically, students will use the agile scrum framework in developing their software project, working in two-week sprints/iterations. This hands-on project course takes a blended approach to learning, mixing online content provided through the school’s e-learning platform (Moodle) with weekly flipped workshop sessions. Throughout the course, students will perform various roles (including scrum master and product owner) and ceremonies (including sprint planning, stand-up sessions, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives and backlog refinement), as well as utilise a number of a tools (such as kanban boards, burndown charts and planning poker).",

When will the next major stock market collapse occur? Which is the greatest sporting nation on earth? Addressing real world problems involves the steps of formulating a mathematical description of the problem, solving the mathematical model, interpreting the mathematical solution and critically evaluating the model. Motivated by real world problems, the course will survey mathematical techniques for: achieving the best possible outcomes, predicting future events and dealing with uncertainties. The course will provide introductions to popular mathematical resources for algebraic manipulation, numerical simulation and presentation. As part of the course requirements, students will be expected to work in groups on mathematical modelling projects and they will be expected to prepare a group report, both written and oral, describing the project. The course aims to equip students with the modelling skills and presentation skills for dealing with real world problems.Read more",

The simplest of these is when there is some way of measuring the distance between two objects. Some of the most important examples of these `metric spaces' occur as sets of functions, so this course looks at ways in which one might say that a sequence of functions converges. Taking these ideas one step further, we look at convergence which does not come from a generalised distance function. These are the ideas of point set topology. The course includes topics such as countability, continuity, uniform convergence and compactness, as well as an introduction to the core areas of function analysis.",

The algebra of adding and multiplying matrices has many similarities with the algebra of numbers. The notion of rings generalises both these two examples.

The course is problem-based so that students will address the issues associated with, and concepts behind, building a simple real time computer system. The course revises the concepts of interrupts and introduces the concept of real-time computing, and discussing why time is important and how it is incorporated into a design , multitasking and multithreading and simple interprocess communication. Students will learn about, and be exposed to various devices providing an interface between a computer and the environment. Fundamental signal processing and control will be covered, including descrete-time processing, signal filtering and conditioning, state machines, PID control, and numerical integration. Although the course will exercise analytical skills, there is a strong emphasis on practical implementation using a Real Time Operating System, and using both the C programming language and embedded Matlab toolboxes to interface to, and control, real hardware.",
