They will learn to think the way that engineers think, coming up with good solutions to problems despite being limited by budget, time and resources, the requirement to also meet environmental and social objectives and of course the limitations of the laws of physics. This will help them to appreciate the central ideas of engineering design as an on-time, on-budget and fit for purpose solution to a poorly specified, open-ended problem. They will be assigned to a team to work over a ten week period to solve a practical problem. The projects on offer change from year to year.  In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.For further information please see ENGG1000Read more","conditions":{"raw":null,"prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":["SENGAH"],"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":["DESN2000","ENGG2600"]},"position":{"x":256.7493576499096,"y":-334.09498464007453},"style":{"display":"flex","textAlign":"center","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","fontSize":10,"width":64,"height":64,"borderRadius":32,"color":"white","background":"white","boxShadow":"0px 0px 2px 0px grey","border":"2px solid #CA1818","transition":"0.5s ease"},"isHidden":false,"textColour":"#CA1818","textSelectedColour":"white","selectableColour":"#efbaba","selectedColour":"#CA1818"},{"id":"MATH1081","type":"custom1","data":{"course_name":"Discrete Mathematics","course_code":"MATH1081","course_level":1,"units":6,"terms":["Term 1","Term 2","Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Science","school":"School of Mathematics & Statistics","desc":"Role of proof in mathematics, logical reasoning and implication, different types of proofs.

It is concerned with the representation of knowledge in symbolic form and the use of this knowledge  for reasoning. This course presents current trends and research issues in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). It enables students interested in Artificial Intelligence to deepen their  knowledge in this important area and gives them a solid background for doing their own work/research in this area. The topics covered in more detail are AI Logics, Probablilistic  Reasoning, Constraints, and Game Theory.Read more","conditions":{"raw":"COMP3411","prereqs_executable":"COMP3411","prerequisites":["COMP3411"],"corequisites":null,"units_required":null,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":["COMP9491"]},"position":{"x":-122.92064606405961,"y":698.0548298720087},"style":{"display":"flex","textAlign":"center","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","fontSize":10,"width":64,"height":64,"borderRadius":32,"color":"white","background":"white","boxShadow":"0px 0px 2px 0px grey","border":"2px solid #1EB13C","transition":"0.5s ease"},"isHidden":false,"textColour":"#1EB13C","textSelectedColour":"white","selectableColour":"#bce8c5","selectedColour":"#1EB13C"},{"id":"COMP4511","type":"custom1","data":{"course_name":"User Interface Design and Construction","course_code":"COMP4511","course_level":4,"units":6,"terms":["Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","school":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","desc":"This course is a project-based course designed to build on the basic skills acquired in COMP3511 – Human Computer Interaction.

Addressing real world problems involves the steps of formulating a mathematical description of the problem, solving the mathematical model, interpreting the mathematical solution and critically evaluating the model. Motivated by real world problems, the course will survey mathematical techniques for: achieving the best possible outcomes, predicting future events and dealing with uncertainties. The course will provide introductions to popular mathematical resources for algebraic manipulation, numerical simulation and presentation. As part of the course requirements, students will be expected to work in groups on mathematical modelling projects and they will be expected to prepare a group report, both written and oral, describing the project. The course aims to equip students with the modelling skills and presentation skills for dealing with real world problems.Read more","conditions":{"raw":"12 units of credit in Level 2 Maths courses.","prereqs_executable":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"units_required":12,"level_for_units_required":2,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":null,"unlocks":null},"position":{"x":-621.5116999035505,"y":-959.6379567518545},"style":{"display":"flex","textAlign":"center","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","fontSize":10,"width":64,"height":64,"borderRadius":32,"color":"white","background":"white","boxShadow":"0px 0px 2px 0px grey","border":"2px solid #166DBA","transition":"0.5s ease"},"isHidden":false,"textColour":"#166DBA","textSelectedColour":"white","selectableColour":"#b9d3ea","selectedColour":"#166DBA"},{"id":"MATH3101","type":"custom1","data":{"course_name":"Computational Mathematics for Science and Engineering","course_code":"MATH3101","course_level":3,"units":6,"terms":["Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Science","school":"School of Mathematics & Statistics","desc":"Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a natural mathematical description for many phenomena of interest in science and engineering.

Some of the most important examples of these `metric spaces' occur as sets of functions, so this course looks at ways in which one might say that a sequence of functions converges. Taking these ideas one step further, we look at convergence which does not come from a generalised distance function. These are the ideas of point set topology. The course includes topics such as countability, continuity, uniform convergence and compactness, as well as an introduction to the core areas of function analysis.","conditions":{"raw":"12 UOC of Level 2 Mathematics with an average mark of at least 70, including MATH2111 or MATH2011 (CR) or MATH2510 (CR), or permission from the Head of Department.","prereqs_executable":"MATH2111 || MATH2011 || 0","prerequisites":["MATH2111","MATH2011"],"corequisites":null,"units_required":12,"level_for_units_required":null,"core_year":null,"other":null},"equivalents":null,"exclusions":["MATH3570","MATH5645","MATH5705"],"unlocks":null},"position":{"x":-504.4374994580983,"y":-1095.062718493488},"style":{"display":"flex","textAlign":"center","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center","fontSize":10,"width":64,"height":64,"borderRadius":32,"color":"white","background":"white","boxShadow":"0px 0px 2px 0px grey","border":"2px solid #166DBA","transition":"0.5s ease"},"isHidden":false,"textColour":"#166DBA","textSelectedColour":"white","selectableColour":"#b9d3ea","selectedColour":"#166DBA"},{"id":"MATH3701","type":"custom2","data":{"course_name":"Higher Topology and Differential Geometry","course_code":"MATH3701","course_level":3,"units":6,"terms":["Term 3"],"faculty":"Faculty of Science","school":"School of Mathematics & Statistics","desc":"Topology and differential geometry both deal with the study of shape: topology from a continuous and differential geometry from a differentiable viewpoint.This course begins with a study of curves in the plane and in space focussing on how they bend.

The algebra of adding and multiplying matrices has many similarities with the algebra of numbers. The notion of rings generalises both these two examples.
