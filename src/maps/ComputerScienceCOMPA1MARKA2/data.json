Events serve to attract visitation and to create an image of and awareness for a destination. Managed appropriately, events can produce sizeable economic and social benefits. Inappropriate management can lead to negative economic, environmental and social impacts. Events require considerable investment, planning and organisation to safeguard the health, safety and security of visitors and participants to ensure operators, visitors and the community derive the maximum possible benefit from the event.
