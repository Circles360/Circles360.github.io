        "desc": "Chemical Product Engineering involves researching, developing and improving the properties of the products that we use every day through the selection and design of the materials that are used. Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You'll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you'll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.\n\nThe courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked here.\n\nThe timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from the School of Chemical Engineering Student Office, should you require it.",

Flexibility and choice are maintained throughout the entire structure by providing many elective courses.\n\nEnvironmental engineers are concerned with the environmental impact of engineering activities. They apply their broad knowledge of engineering and environmental processes in identifying environmental problems and in developing effective solutions to them. They also coordinate the activities of specialist groups such as biologists, ecologists and geologists within major projects. The discipline of environmental engineering embraces parts of civil engineering, with emphasis on management, systems design, water, geotechnical and transport engineering, together with aspects of chemical engineering, applied and biological sciences and environmental studies.\n\nThis stream can be taken on a four-year full-time basis or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.\n\nA detailed stream structure can be found on the School website, which includes suggested scheduling of courses by semester. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.\n                                  ",

This program aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and the numerous Spatial Information disciplines. To this end the program covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Spatial Information topics. Specialisation is provided for through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner. \n\nSuggestions for course sequences consistent with timetabling and availability can be found on the School website The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student's choice of courses.While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.\n                                  ",

The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology & Automation.\n\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the 'big picture' as well as 'the specific details'. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.\n\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.\n\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.\n                                  ",

For over 100 years, it has been known that the behaviour of physical systems at the atomic scale does not obey the familiar laws of classical physics. Atomic-size systems behave according to quantum mechanics, which allows them to exhibit rather spectacular properties and dynamics. This stream trains students to design and operate devices that behave according to quantum mechanics, opening the possibility to exploit the peculiar laws of quantum physics to perform otherwise cumbersome or impossible tasks, such as the efficient solution of computationally hard problems, or the secure teleportation of information. Graduates from this stream will have valuable skills that position them ideally for the burgeoning quantum engineering industry, as well as broad skills across most key electrical engineering disciplines.",

This stream aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and the numerous Spatial Information disciplines. To this end the stream covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Spatial Information topics. Specialisation is provided for through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner. \n\nThe degree of BE in Surveying is recognised by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales as meeting the requirements for entry as a candidate to become a Registered Surveyor. The degree is also recognised by the Institution of Surveyors, New South Wales, the Spatial Sciences Institute and Engineers Australia, for admission as corporate members.\n\nSuggestions for course sequences consistent with timetabling and availability can be found on the School website The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student's choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.\n\nThe day to day administration of the stream is conducted through the School of Civil & Environmental Engineering, to which inquiries should be directed.\n                                  ",

The School's undergraduate BE (Hons) program in Telecommunications continue to act as a model for educating engineers in tomorrow's technology. Options within Telecommunications include: Photonics, Systems and Control, Energy Systems, Microelectronics and Signal Processing. The Degree programs are accredited by Engineers Australia as meeting the requirements for admission to graduate membership.\n\nThe undergraduate curricula are being progressively revised to provide flexible training to suit the future needs of students. Individual student needs can be further met by substitution provisions within the programs.\n\nThe Telecommunications stream consists of 168 UOC as described below. The stream structure outlined below gives one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the degree. The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student's choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Students are strongly encouraged to consult the Electrical Engineering School website for the recommended program structure and for advice on course selection sequences that are consistent with timetabling and availability.\n                                  ",
