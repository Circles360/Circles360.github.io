Some epistemological issues that the course might explore include these: what it is for a thought or claim to be true; what it is for a thought or claim to be rationally well supported; what it is for a thought or claim to be knowledge; what it is to have knowledge via the senses; what it is to have knowledge purely via reason; and whether it might be impossible for us ever to have any knowledge or rational support at all.", "conditions": {"raw": "Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1", "prereqs_executable": null, "prerequisites": null, "corequisites": null, "units_required": null, "level_for_units_required": null, "core_year": null, "other": null}, "equivalents": null, "exclusions": null, "unlocks": []}, "ARTS2361": {"course_name": "Philosophy of Mind and Psychology", "course_code": "ARTS2361", "course_level": 2, "units": 6, "terms": ["Term 1"], "faculty": "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences", "school": "School of Humanities and Languages", "desc": "What is a mind?

A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers: that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability. You will find that central to this course is the proposition that social research is a form of intervention in the social and cultural world, which may have major consequences on people\u2019s lives. So too you will develop an understanding of your \u2018subjective positioning\u2019 and will come to find ways to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies.

Multiple aspects of genome biology will be studied and integrated to understand how genomes function and evolve. Core concepts and methods in genomics, molecular evolution and population genetics will be supported by an integrated set of tutorials, science communication tasks and bioinformatics analysis.

Selected bioprocesses will be used to develop an understanding of fundamental bioprocessing principles, including process scale-up. Examples will be drawn from major biotechnology sectors, including biofuels, biopharmaceutical manufacture and manufacture of other bioproducts from bacterial, yeast and mammalian hosts. Laboratory sessions and problem solving tutorials (including computer based classes)will supplement lecture material.
