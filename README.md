# Circles

## Overview

Circles is a **visual degree planner** for UNSW undergraduate students, available [here](circles360.github.io). By representing a degree as a flowchart, Circles makes it easy for anyone to choose and explore which direction they would like to take their degree in. Once students have chosen the courses that they would like to take, a degree plan is automatically generated for them, which takes into account course prerequisites and term availability. Students can then drag and drop courses as needed to customise their degree plan.

Our project can be split into 3 subprojects:
1. 2021 Handbook Scraper
2. Flowchart
3. Smart Degree Planner

**NOTE:** Currently only SENGAH (Software Engineering), and COMPA1 (Computer Science) with its optional minors are supported. This is because each degree requires a manual check to ensure there were no errors (many times the Handbook is missing information ðŸ˜¢). Since we were all learning React for the first time, we didn't have time for this task.

**NOTE:** The UNSW handbook is currently undergoing updates for 2021. Although we try our best, some data may be incorrect or outdated, so some nodes on our flowchart may not be selectable. Please refer to the handbook for the latest update.

### 1. 2021 Handbook Scraper

The scraper is written in **python** and is located in `/src/webscraper`. It scrapes all faculty's programs, and each program's specialisations and honours degrees. It also scrapes all courses available to undergraduate students. This information is then dumped into the corresponding `.json` files to be read by the Flowchart.

The scraper ignores irrelevant faculties such as **DVC (Academic Board of Studies)**, **UNSW Canberra** and **UNSW Global** and their respective courses since Circles is for typical undergraduate students in Sydney.

To prevent `403 errors` from occuring, a random interval between 15 and 20 seconds is set between each page request. It takes just over 13 hours to accumulate all necessary data.

Manual fixes are documented in `manual_fixes.txt` when we found an error (such as missing prerequisites not listed by the Handbook, e.g. [DESN2000](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/DESN2000/))

### 2. Flowchart

Our flowchart is rendered using the `react-flow-renderer` npm library. It reads all the data scraped by the web scraper and displays relevant courses and their prerequisites onto the screen. Coures are represented by circular nodes, and prerequisites are represented by edges. Clicking a course marks it as taken, and unlocks future courses.

Features include:
- courses partially light up if they *can* be selected but are not yet selected
- double clicking an exclusion course switches to its respective course and loads new prerequisites if any
- hovering over a node shows the courses required to take it
- hovering over a node displays information about it in the top left corner, such as:
  - term availability
  - full conditions required to take it (as scraped from the 2021 Handbook)
- deselecting a node deselects all courses that rely on it
- search bar to find a node (CTRL-F is an alternative)

The sidebar further requirements that need to be fulfilled when planning a degree. It separates courses into each core level and shows when a level requirement has been met. Not all levels show the number of units required - this is because of limited information available in the handbook.

### 3. Smart Degree Planner

The smart degree planner was designed with the `react-beautiful-dnd` npm library and takes all the courses selected by the Flowchart and allocates them a term to be taken in during your degree. As explained on the page, our algorithm:
- allocates 18 UOC per term
- ensures courses have their prerequisites met
- ensures courses are offered in allocated terms
- does not allocate courses in Summer term

The smart degree planner updates everytime a course is added or removed (selected or deselected from the Flowchart).

Once courses have been allocated, students can drag and drop courses to personalise their degree plan. Each time a course is moved, the algorithm will ensure all prerequisites are met and that each course is offered in the enrolled term. If not, a consideration message will appear at the top.

**Note:** These messages are called *considerations* and not *errors* because there is always the possibility our data is incorrect due to limited information provided by the Handbook. We want to allow students to still be able to use the degree planner even if we have made a mistake.

## Hasn't this been done before?

Yeah, it has, but not well. We wanted to create a product that was both visually informative and easy to use. These qualities were not present in our competitors:

- [CSESoc's Degree Planner](https://github.com/csesoc/degree-planner): isn't deployed, and when run locally only has data for 4 degrees. Circles has data ready for all programs and degrees.
- [UPlanner](https://uplanner.bopa.ng/): doesn't exist anymore and also did not consider prerequisites.
- [Joebangles](https://joebangles.tobinsmit.com/): an outdated service and also does not check prerequisites.
- [Triangles](https://triangles.tobinsmit.com/): does not check prerequisties and courses have to be manually added.
